<p>In this article, we will talk about all known attacks on the blockchain, as well as smart contract vulnerabilities. Blockchain isn’t really as secure as we tend to think. Though security is integrated throughout all blockchain technology, even the strongest blockchains come under attack by modern cybercriminals.</p>



<p>Blockchains can resist traditional cyber attacks quite well, but cybercriminals are coming up with new approaches specifically for hacking blockchain technology. In this article, we describe the main attack vectors against blockchain technology and take a look at the most significant blockchain attacks to date.</p>



<p>Cybercriminals have already managed to misuse blockchains to perform malicious actions.&nbsp; Ransomware attacks</a>&nbsp;like&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WannaCry</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petya_(malware)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Petya;wouldn’t have been so massive if attackers hadn’t received their rewards in cryptocurrencies. Now, it looks like hackers consider exploiting blockchain security vulnerabilities as their main source of revenue.</p>



<p>In March 2019, white hat hackersfound 43 bugs in various blockchain and cryptocurrency platforms in just 30 days. They even found vulnerabilities in such famous platforms as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coinbase.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptodeeptech.ru/publication/#/dev-blog/553-eos-smart-contract-vulnerability" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EOS</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptodeeptech.ru/publication/#/dev-blog/602-tezos-blockchain-smart-contract-overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tezos</a>.</p>



<p>However, weak spots are often challenging to detect, since they can be hidden in unobvious places. For instance, the&nbsp;<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/parity-multisig-wallet-hacked-or-how-come" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Parity multisig wallet was hacked</a>&nbsp;by breaking a library that had a withdraw function in it. The attacker managed to initialize the library itself as a wallet and claim owner rights to it. As a result, 573 wallets were affected, $30 million worth of crypto was stolen, and another $180 million rescued by a white hat hacker group was later returned to the rightful owners.</p>


<p>By attacking such huge networks as&nbsp;<a href="https://bitcoin.org/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://ethereum.org/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum</a>, cybercriminals show that they’re clever enough to disprove the myth of blockchain security. Let’s consider the five most common blockchain attack vectors:</p>

<p>A blockchain network includes nodes that create and run transactions and provide other services. For instance, the Bitcoin network is formed by nodes that send and receive transactions and miners that add approved transactions to blocks. Cybercriminals look for network vulnerabilities and exploit them with the following types of attacks.</p>

<p><a href="https://cryptodeep.ru/doc/DISTRIBUTED_DENIAL_OF_SERVICE_(DDOS)_ATTACKS_DETECTION_MECHANISM.pdf">Distributed denial of service&nbsp;(DDoS) attacks</a> are hard to execute on a blockchain network, but they’re possible.</p>



<p>When attacking a blockchain network using DDoS, hackers intend to bring down a server by consuming all its processing resources with numerous requests. DDoS attackers aim to disconnect a network’s mining pools, e-wallets, crypto exchanges, and other financial services. A blockchain can also be hacked with DDoS at its application layer using DDoS botnets.</p>



<p>In 2017, Bitfinex suffered from a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/worlds-largest-bitcoin-exchange" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massive DDoS attack</a>. It was especially inconvenient for the IOTA Foundation, which had launched their IOTA token on the platform the day before Bitfinex informed users about the attack.

<h3><a href="https://cryptodeep.ru/doc/Bitcoin_Transaction_Malleability_and_MtGox.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Transaction Malleability Attacks</a></h3>



<p>A transaction malleability attack is intended to trick the victim into paying twice. In the Bitcoin network, every transaction has a hash that’s a transaction ID. If attackers manage to alter a transaction’s ID, they can try to broadcast the transaction with a changed hash to the network and have it confirmed before the original transaction. If this succeeds, the sender will believe the initial transaction has failed, while the funds will still be withdrawn from the sender’s account. And if the sender repeats the transaction, the same amount will be debited twice. This hack is successful once the two transactions are confirmed by miners.</p>

<h3><a href="https://cryptodeep.ru/doc/Vulnerabilities_and_Security_Breaches_in_Cryptocurrencies.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Timejacking Attack</a></h3>



<p>Timejacking exploits a theoretical vulnerability in Bitcoin timestamp handling. During a timejacking attack, a hacker alters the network time counter of the node and forces the node to accept an alternative blockchain. This can be achieved when a malicious user adds multiple fake peers to the network with inaccurate timestamps. However, a timejacking attack can be prevented by restricting acceptance time ranges or using the node’s system time.</p>



<p>The timejacking attack is also an extension of the Sybil attack. Each node maintains a time counter which is based on the median time of its peers, and if the median time differs from the system time by a certain value, then the node reverts to the system time. An attacker can flood the network with nodes reporting inaccurate timestamps, which can cause the network to slow down or speed up, leading to a desynchronization.</p>

<p>A routing attack can impact both individual nodes and the whole network. The idea of this hack is to tamper with transactions before pushing them to peers. It’s nearly impossible for other nodes to detect this tampering, as the hacker divides the network into partitions that are unable to communicate with each other. Routing attacks actually consist of two separate attacks:</p>



<ol>
<li>A partition attack, which divides the network nodes into separate groups</li>



<li>A delay attack, which tampers with propagating messages and sends them to the network</li>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Figure 1. Sybil attack</em></p>



<p>During a Sybil attack, a hacker takes control of multiple nodes in the network. Then the victim is surrounded by fake nodes that close up all their transactions. Finally, the victim becomes open to&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptodeeptech.ru/publication/#/dev-blog/578-blockchain-attack-vectors#double">double-spending attacks</a>. A Sybil attack is quite difficult to detect and prevent, but the following measures can be effective: increasing the cost of creating a new identity, requiring some type of trust for joining the network, or determining&nbsp;<a href="https://delaat.net/rp/2017-2018/p97/report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">user power based on reputation</a>.</p>



<p>A sybil attack is defined by Wikipedia as “<em>a type of attack on a computer network service in which an attacker subverts the service’s reputation system by creating a large number of pseudonymous identities and uses them to gain a disproportionately large influence.</em>” If the network does not keep the count of the nodes, then the attacker can completely isolate the victim node from the network. The sybil attack on blockchain also works similarly, where an attacker tries to flood the network with their controlled nodes so that the victim only connects to the attacker controlled nodes. This can lead to a wide variety of damages where the attacker can prevent genuine blocks from being added to the chain, the attacker can add their own blocks to the chain, or they can cause confusion among the nodes, hampering the general functioning of the blockchain network.</p>



<p>In the above visual representation, the red nodes are controlled by the attacker, and they flood the network, making the victim connect only to a malicious node.</p>

<h2><a href="https://cryptodeep.ru/doc/Sybil_Attacks_on_Identity-Augmented_Proof-of-Stake.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sybil Attacks on Identity-Augmented Proof-of-Stake</a></h2>



<p>IdAPoS is an identity-based consensus protocol for decentralised Blockchain networks that implements a trustless reputation system by extending Proof-of-Stake to facilitate leader selection in non-economic contexts. Like any protocol operating in a public/permissionless setting, it is vulnerable to Sybil attacks in which byzantine actors interfere with peer sampling by presenting artificially large numbers of identities. This paper demonstrates what influence these attacks have on the stability of member selection of a Blockchain system using the IdAPoS protocol and investigates how attacks can be mitigated. As a novel protocol, its vulnerability to this type of attack has not previously been researched. The research question is approached via an agent-based model of an IdAPoS system in which both honest and malicious actors are represented as agents. Simulations are run on some reasonable configurations of an IdAPoS system that employ different attack mitigation strategies. The results show that a super strategy that combines multiple individual mitigation strategies is more effective for containing Sybil attacks than the unmitigated protocol and any other individual strategies proposed. In the simulation this strategy extended the time until a system was taken over by a malicious entity approximately by a factor of 5. These positive initial results indicate that further research into the practical viability of the protocol is warranted</p>

<h3><a href="https://cryptodeep.ru/doc/Eclipse_Attacks_on_Bitcoin.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eclipse Attacks on Bitcoin</a></h3>



<p>An eclipse attack requires a hacker to control a large number of IP addresses or to have a distributed botnet. Then the attacker overwrites the addresses in the “tried” table of the victim node and waits until the victim node is restarted. After restarting, all outgoing connections of the victim node will be redirected to the IP addresses controlled by the attacker. This makes the victim unable to obtain transactions they’re interested in. Researchers from Boston University&nbsp;<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/researchers-explore-eclipse-attacks-ethereum-blockchain" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">initiated</a>&nbsp;an eclipse attack on the Ethereum network and managed to do it using just one or two machines.</p>



<p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-an-eclipse-attack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eclipse attack</a>&nbsp;arises in the blockchains, where the architecture partitions workloads and assigns tasks among the peers. As an example, if a chain has a node that has only eight outgoing connections and can support at most 128 threads at any given moment, each node has view access to only the nodes that are connected to it. The view of the chain for the victim node can be changed if an attacker attacks a specific node and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/eclipse-attacks-defense-bitcoin#section-how-are-cryptocurrency-eclipse-attacks-executed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gains control of the eight nodes</a>&nbsp;connected to it. This can lead to a wide variety of damages that include double spending of the coins by tricking a victim that a particular transaction has not occurred, and also the attacks against the second layer protocols. The attacker can make the victim believe that a payment channel is open when it is closed, tricking the victim to initiate a transaction. The following diagram demonstrates a node under Eclipse attack.</p>

First, we outline an eclipse attack that allows an adversary to partition the peer-to-peer network without monopolizing the connections of the victim. This is attack is possible by exploiting the block propagation design of Ethereum. Second, we present an exploit to force a node to accept a longer chain with lower total difficulty than the main chain. Finally, we outline a bug in Ethereum’s difficulty calculation.

<p>In 2018, there was an&nbsp;<a href="https://alex.studer.dev/2018/01/28/iotaseed.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attack</a>&nbsp;on IOTA wallets initiated with iotaseed.io (now offline), a fake online seed generator. Hackers conducted a phishing campaign with this service and collected logs with secret seeds. As a result, in January 2018, hackers successfully stole more than $4 million worth of IOTA from victims’ wallets.</p>

<p>Blockchain networks use various cryptographic algorithms to create user signatures, but they may also have vulnerabilities. For example, Bitcoin uses the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ECDSA cryptographic algorithm</a>&nbsp;to automatically generate unique private keys. However, it appears that ECDSA has insufficient&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptodeeptech.ru/publication/#/dev-blog/535-entropy-as-a-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">entropy</a>, which can result in the same random value in more than one signature.

<h2>Novel Solutions to Novel Problems</h2>



<p>Blockchain technology is new and interesting, and as such, thousands of tech startups and hundreds of established companies are working in the space. It’s ripe for innovation and experimentation, but that always opens up room for new attacks. All it takes is forgetting a key element of security along the way to leave a vulnerability open in new technology.</p>



<p>One of the most interesting uses of blockchain technology involves divorcing it from the cryptocurrency aspect of the tech and using the core blockchain protocol in other ways. This has fascinating potential and requires a lot of critical thinking and testing to spot potential security issues in the implementation of new technology.</p>

<p>The most famous cryptocurrency is Bitcoin, but there are many others, such as Ethereum, Litecoin, and Monero. Cryptocurrencies are often bought and sold on decentralized exchanges and can also be used to purchase goods and services.</p>



<h4><strong>How Do Cryptocurrencies Work?</strong></h4>



<p>Cryptocurrencies use blockchain technology to create a secure, decentralized ledger of all transactions. Blockchain is a secure distributed database from hacking because it uses cryptography to encrypt transactions and prevent double-spending.</p>



<p>Whenever a transaction is made, it is recorded on the blockchain and verified by a network of computers. This makes it impossible to spend the same cryptocurrency twice fraudulently. It also makes cryptocurrencies much more secure than traditional fiat currencies, which are vulnerable to counterfeiters.</p>

<p>Since cryptocurrencies are digital and often stored in online wallets, they are vulnerable to hacking. In fact, there have been several&nbsp;<a href="https://wesecureapp.com/blog/bfsi-case-study/">high-profile hacks</a>&nbsp;of cryptocurrency exchanges in recent years, resulting in the loss of millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>In early May 2021, a&nbsp;<a href="https://wesecureapp.com/blog/the-10-biggest-ransomware-attacks-of-2021-infographic/">ransomware attack</a>&nbsp;struck the Colonial Pipeline. This attack resulted in the shutdown of the pipeline, which provides much of the fuel for the East Coast of the United States. The hackers demanded a ransom of $5 million in Bitcoin, and they got it.</p>



<p>This is just one example of how criminals use cryptocurrency to extort money from victims. Below, we’ve listed the major cryptocurrency scams affecting the cybersecurity of businesses and the security of companies and individuals.</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Investment Scams:</strong>&nbsp;These scams lure victims with the promise of high returns on their investment in a new cryptocurrency. The reality is that these scammers will take your money and disappear.</li>



<li><strong>Phishing Scams:</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://wesecureapp.com/blog/how-to-mitigate-phishing-attacks-in-your-organization/">Phishing</a>&nbsp;is a type of cyber-attack that involves criminals sending fake emails or messages that look like they come from a legitimate source, such as a cryptocurrency exchange. These messages will often contain links that lead to counterfeit websites that steal your login credentials or infect your computer with malware.</li>



<li><strong>Ponzi Schemes:</strong>&nbsp;A Ponzi scheme is a type of investment scam that promises high returns but instead uses the money from new investors to pay old investors. These schemes eventually collapse, leaving the new investors with nothing.</li>



<li><strong>Initial Coin Offering (ICO) Fraud:</strong>&nbsp;An ICO is a crowdfunding campaign used to raise funds for new cryptocurrencies. However, many ICOs are scams, and the people behind them will take your money and disappear.</li>



<li><strong>Malware:&nbsp;</strong>Cryptocurrency mining requires a lot of computing power, which criminals can harness to mine cryptocurrency for themselves. They do this by infecting your computer with malware that allows them to use your resources to mine cryptocurrency. This can slow down your computer and use up a lot of your electricity.</li>
</ol>



<h4><strong>How Does Cryptocurrency Affect the Security of Your Business?</strong></h4>



<p>Cryptocurrencies are often used in ransomware attacks, as we saw with the Colonial Pipeline attack. In these attacks, hackers will encrypt your data and demand a ransom in cryptocurrency to decrypt it. These attacks can be very costly for businesses, as they have to pay the ransom and deal with the downtime caused by the attack. In some cases, companies may not be able to recover their data even after paying the ransom.</p>



<p>Cryptocurrency can also buy and sell illegal goods and services on the dark web. This includes things like drugs, weapons, and child pornography. By using cryptocurrency, criminals can buy and sell these items anonymously without fear of being caught. This makes it very difficult for law enforcement to track down these criminals.</p>

<li>Be careful when accepting cryptocurrency as payment. Make sure you understand the risks involved before you agree to receive it.</li>



<li>If you use cryptocurrency to buy or sell goods and services, only deal with reputable companies. Be aware of the risks involved in doing this.</li>
</ol>



<p>You can help&nbsp;<a href="https://wesecureapp.com/blog/top-5-cloud-security-controls-you-should-be-using/">protect your business</a>&nbsp;from cryptocurrency scams by taking these measures.</p>



<h4><strong>What is the future of cryptocurrency?</strong></h4>



<p>The future of cryptocurrency is uncertain, and it remains to be seen whether it will become widely adopted or fade into obscurity.</p>



<p>Cryptocurrency has the potential to revolutionize the way we conduct business and interact with each other. However, it also has the potential to be used for criminal activity.</p>



<p>Only time will tell what the future of cryptocurrency holds. In the meantime, it’s essential to exercise caution when dealing with it.</p>



<p>Cybercriminals can make money from attacking your organization’s software systems, such as stealing credit card numbers or online banking credentials. However, there are other more sophisticated ways to monetize their actions that aren’t as obvious as stealing money.</p>



<p>Attackers may infect your system with malware that grants remote access to a command and control server. Once they have infected hundreds or even thousands of computers they can establish a botnet, which can be used to send phishing emails, launch other cyber attacks, steal sensitive data, or mine cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>Another common motivation is to gain access to personally identifiable information (PII), healthcare information, and biometrics to commit insurance fraud, credit card fraud or illegally obtain prescription drugs.</p>



<p>Competitors may employ attackers to perform corporate espionage or overload your data centers with a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack to cause downtime, harm sales, and cause customers to leave your business.</p>



<p>Money is not the only motivator. Attackers may want to leak information to the public, embarrass certain organizations, grow political ideologies, or perform cyber warfare on behalf of their government like the United States or China.</p>



<p>How Do Attackers Exploit Attack Vectors?<br>There are many ways to expose, alter, disable, destroy, steal or gain unauthorized access to computer systems, infrastructure, networks, operating systems, and IoT devices.</p>



<p>In general, attack vectors can be split into passive or active attacks:</p>



<p>Passive Attack Vector Exploits<br>Passive attack vector exploits are attempts to gain access or make use of information from the system without affecting system resources, such as typosquatting, phishing, and other social engineering-based attacks.</p>



<p>Active Attack Vector Exploits<br>Active cyber attack vector exploits are attempts to alter a system or affect its operation such as malware, exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities, email spoofing, man-in-the-middle attacks, domain hijacking, and ransomware.</p>



<p>That said, most attack vectors share similarities:</p>



<p>The attacker identifies a potential target<br>The attacker gathers information about the target using social engineering, malware, phishing, OPSEC, and automated vulnerability scanning<br>Attackers use the information to identify possible attack vectors and create or use tools to exploit them<br>Attackers gain unauthorized access to the system and steal sensitive data or install malicious code<br>Attackers monitor the computer or network, steal information, or use computing resources.<br>One often overlooked attack vector is your third and fourth-party vendors and service providers. It doesn’t matter how sophisticated your internal network security and information security policies are — if vendors have access to sensitive data, they are a huge risk to your organization.</p>



<p>This is why it is important to measure and mitigate third-party risks and fourth-party risks. This means it needs to be part of your information security policy and information risk management program.</p>



<p>Consider investing in threat intelligence tools that help automate vendor risk management and automatically monitor your vendor’s security posture and notify you if it worsens.</p>



<p>Every organization now needs a third-party risk management framework, vendor management policy, and vendor risk management program.</p>



<p>Before considering a new vendor perform a cybersecurity risk assessment to understand what attack vectors you could be introducing to your organization by using them and ask about their SOC 2 compliance.</p>



<p>What are the Common Types of Attack Vectors?</p>



<ol>
<li>Compromised Credentials<br>‍Usernames and passwords are still the most common type of access credential and continue to be exposed in data leaks, phishing scams, and malware. When lost, stolen, or exposed, credentials give attackers unfettered access. This is why organizations are now investing in tools to continuously monitor for data exposures and leaked credentials. Password managers, two-factor authentication (2FA), multi-factor authentication (MFA), and biometrics can reduce the risk of leak credentials resulting in a security incident too.</li>



<li>Weak Credentials<br>‍Weak passwords and reused passwords mean one data breach can result in many more. Teach your organization how to create a secure password, invest in a password manager or a single sign-on tool, and educate staff on their benefits.</li>



<li>Insider Threats<br>‍Disgruntled employees or malicious insiders can expose private information or provide information about company-specific vulnerabilities.</li>



<li>Missing or Poor Encryption<br>‍Common data encryption methods like SSL certificates and DNSSEC can prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and protect the confidentiality of data being transmitted. Missing or poor encryption for data at rest can mean that sensitive data or credentials are exposed in the event of a data breach or data leak.</li>



<li>Misconfiguration<br>‍Misconfiguration of cloud services, like Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, or AWS, or using default credentials can lead to data breaches and data leaks, check your S3 permissions or someone else will. Automate configuration management where possible to prevent configuration drift.</li>



<li>Ransomware<br>‍Ransomware is a form of extortion where data is deleted or encrypted unless a ransom is paid, such as WannaCry. Minimize the impact of ransomware attacks by maintaining a defense plan, including keeping your systems patched and backing up important data.</li>



<li>Phishing<br>‍Phishing attacks are social engineering attacks where the target is contacted by email, telephone, or text message by someone who is posing to be a legitimate colleague or institution to trick them into providing sensitive data, credentials, or personally identifiable information (PII). Fake messages can send users to malicious websites with viruses or malware payloads.</li>
</ol>



<p>Learn the different types of phishing attacks here.</p>



<ol start="8">
<li>Vulnerabilities<br>‍New security vulnerabilities are added to the CVE every day and zero-day vulnerabilities are found just as often. If a developer has not released a patch for a zero-day vulnerability before an attack can exploit it, it can be hard to prevent zero-day attacks.</li>
</ol>



<ol start="9">
<li>Brute Force<br>‍Brute force attacks are based on trial and error. Attackers may continuously try to gain access to your organization until one attack works. This could be by attacking weak passwords or encryption, phishing emails, or sending infected email attachments containing a type of malware. Read our full post on brute force attacks.</li>



<li>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)<br>DDoS attacks are cyber attacks against networked resources like data centers, servers, websites, or web applications and can limit the availability of a computer system. The attacker floods the network resource with messages which cause it to slow down or even crash, making it inaccessible to users. Potential mitigations include CDNs and proxies.</li>



<li>SQL Injections<br>‍SQL stands for a structured query language, a programming language used to communicate with databases. Many of the servers that store sensitive data use SQL to manage the data in their database. An SQL injection uses malicious SQL to get the server to expose information it otherwise wouldn’t. This is a huge cyber risk if the database stores customer information, credit card numbers, credentials, or other personally identifiable information (PII).</li>



<li>Trojans<br>‍Trojan horses are malware that misleads users by pretending to be a legitimate program and are often spread via infected email attachments or fake malicious software.</li>



<li>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)<br>XSS attacks involve injecting malicious code into a website but the website itself is not being attacked, rather it aims to impact the website’s visitors. A common way attackers can deploy cross-site scripting attacks is by injecting malicious code into a comment e.g. embedding a link to malicious JavaScript in a blog post’s comment section.</li>



<li>Session Hijacking<br>‍When you log into a service, it generally provides your computer with a session key or cookie so you don’t need to log in again. This cookie can be hijacked by an attacker who uses it to gain access to sensitive information.</li>



<li>Man-in-the-Middle Attacks<br>‍Public Wi-Fi networks can be exploited to perform man-in-the-middle attacks and intercept traffic that was supposed to go elsewhere, such as when you log into a secure system.</li>



<li>Third and Fourth-Party Vendors<br>‍The rise in outsourcing means that your vendors pose a huge cybersecurity risk to your customer’s data and your proprietary data. Some of the biggest data breaches were caused by third parties.</li>
